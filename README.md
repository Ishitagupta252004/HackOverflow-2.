Today, the globe wastes or loses nearly a third of the food it generates, while approximately 690 million people remain hungry. If we keep throwing away 1/3 of the produced food, we’ll need 2 planets to feed 10 billion people in 2050. Reusing and recycling food waste is only a portion of the answer. It’s the prevention that we need most to achieve a sustainable food future. On the basis of past logs of ration shops and food suppliers, we can understand the consumption patterns. Similarly, with the past municipality logs and waste analysis of fast-running restaurants, we can understand the wastage on a periodic basis. Given these examples as references, you can explore more such datasets to broaden your horizon and come up with a sustainable solution for this problem by incorporating AI.
